          <div class="col-sm text-right">I've been using computers for as long as I can remember.
            My earliest memories of computers involved running home from church on a sunday just to
            boot up Windows 2000 on the family computer to play my video game. Over time we upgraded 
            the computer and I played more and more video games. In high school, I took every IT class
            that I could. My final year timetable had three IT classes. All the IT classes at my school took 
            place in the same computer lab, they would often have three or four classes in there at any given time.
            Due to this, I spent more time in that computer lab than in any other singular classroom.
            I was probably a pretty difficult student throughout my high school years, but I had one teacher 
            who made it worth it to go to school everyday. In return, I tried to put effort into my work and classes with him.
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm text-center">Currently I'm studying at RMIT University in Melbourne. I started here in March of 2019.
            I'm studying a Bachelors of Information Technology. Currently it's only first year so I haven't been able to specialise 
            in anything yet. I'm first year at RMIT, but I have already completed half a degree at Griffith University in Brisbane.
            I had to leave there halfway through 2018 due to personal circumstances. From August 2017 to January of 2019, I worked 
            in Brisbane as a Bartender. As a programmer I've got experience with a variety of languages. I can write in HTML, CSS, PHP, 
            and Javascript for web based programming. I can also write in Java, C++, C#, Python, and SQL for more object oriented programming.
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm text-left">I'm hoping to move into Machine Leaarning and Artificial Intelligence, and later in my career perhaps,
            Virtual Intelligence as well. I don't quite subscribe to the idea that Artificial Intelligence will take over the world. Although I 
            do believe that if an AI is given information and concludes that getting rid of humans is truly the best course of action for the planet, 
            I'd probably be inclined to agree. In my experience, humans really aren't that great. Especcially when it comes to climate change and whatnot.
            Or Civil Rights. However, I'm not too keen to die just yet, so I probably won't be creating that sort of an AI yet. If you take a look through 
            my personal projects, Frank is going to be my final year project at uni, so please don't steal that one.</div>
